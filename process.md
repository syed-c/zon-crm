#### Database Schema
```typescript
userSessions: defineTable({
  email: v.string(),
  sessionId: v.string(),
  expiresAt: v.number(),
  isActive: v.boolean(),
}).index("by_email", ["email"])
  .index("by_session_id", ["sessionId"])
  .index("by_expires_at", ["expiresAt"])
```

#### Key Functions
- **`login`**: Validates credentials and creates session
- **`getCurrentUser`**: Retrieves user data from session
- **`signOut`**: Invalidates session and logs out user

#### Security Features

## Recent Changes (since last push)

### OTP-based Admin Verification and JWT Sessions
- Implemented email OTP flow with secure cookie storage:
  - `app/api/send-otp/route.ts`: generates 6-digit OTP, stores base64 cookie `otp` (HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict, Path=/, 5 min, secure only in prod), emails via SMTP using Nodemailer and env vars.
  - `app/api/verify-otp/route.ts`: robust try/catch; validates cookie and OTP with constant-time comparison; issues `auth_token` JWT cookie (1h) signed with `JWT_SECRET`; logs errors safely.
- Switched JWT implementation to Edge-compatible `jose`:
  - `lib/jwt.ts`: `signAdminToken`, `verifyToken` with HS256 and `"1h"` expiry.
- Middleware-based protection:
  - `middleware.ts`: validates `auth_token` for protected routes; redirects to `/login` when missing/invalid; excludes public routes.
- Frontend:
  - `components/simple-login-page-content.tsx`: two-step OTP UI, uses `credentials: "include"` for fetch.
  - Removed legacy localStorage auth loops; simplified shell.
  - `app/api/me/route.ts` and `components/app-shell.tsx`: cookie-based user fetch to render authenticated UI without flashes.

### Supabase Integration for Dynamic Dashboard
- Added Supabase client:
  - `lib/supabaseClient.ts` using `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

## 2025-09-17 – Tasks page migrated to Supabase

Context: `/tasks` previously used Convex APIs and some hardcoded/demo data. We migrated it to Supabase REST to align with the rest of the app and Vercel deployment.

Changed files:

- `components/tasks-page-content.tsx`
  - Removed Convex `useQuery`/`useMutation` usage and imports.
  - Added Supabase client usage to:
    - Fetch projects from `projects (id,name)`.
    - Fetch tasks by `project_id` and compute simple stats client-side.
    - Insert, update status, and delete tasks through Supabase.
  - Adjusted schema expectations to match current DB:
    - Dropped `description` and `priority` from Supabase select/insert because these columns do not exist in the user's DB.
    - UI still shows description/priority for now; description is not sent, priority badge is visual only.
  - Normalized task status values to match Supabase enum:
    - `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`.
    - New tasks default to `pending`.
  - Made component resilient to either `id` (Supabase) or legacy `_id` keys when rendering/updating/deleting.
  - Kept existing styling and UX intact.

Deployment notes:

- Ensure environment variables are set on Vercel:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- The tasks queries assume the following columns exist in Supabase:
  - `tasks`: `id`, `project_id`, `title`, `status`, `due_date`, `created_at`.
  - Optional: add nullable `description text`, `priority text` to persist those fields. If added, re-enable sending `description` and `priority` in `tasks-page-content.tsx` (search for commented lines near `insertPayload`).
- Status enum in DB must include: `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `blocked`.

RLS policies (example):

```sql
-- Read tasks for everyone (adjust as needed)
create policy if not exists "tasks read" on public.tasks for select using (true);

-- Write tasks for authenticated users
create policy if not exists "tasks write" on public.tasks for all to authenticated using (true) with check (true);
```

Known limitations after migration:

- Content page migration to Supabase
  - `components/content-page-content.tsx` now fetches from `content` table and writes via Supabase.
  - To prevent 400 errors from missing columns, reads are limited to guaranteed fields: `id,title,status,created_at`.
  - Create Content inserts `title` and `status` by default; optionally sends `url` and `project_id`. Additional optional columns like `target_keyword`, `word_count`, `file_url` are commented out in code until present in DB.
  - UI displays URL only if available and supports snake_case fields (`target_keyword`, `word_count`).
  - Tabs counts are computed client-side from fetched rows.

  Storage upload support
  - Added file upload in the create content dialog. Files are uploaded to Supabase Storage bucket defined by env `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` (defaults to `content`).
  - After successful upload, the public URL is saved in `file_url` if the column exists, otherwise the insert retries without it.
  - For uploads to work, create a bucket in Supabase named to match the env var and set appropriate public/private policies.

  RLS / Policies
  Review flow mapping
  - DB enum for `content.status` allows `draft` and `published` only.
  - Submit for Review keeps content as `draft` but sets the related project's status to `in_progress` (falls back to `active` if enum missing).
  - The "In Progress" tab shows content whose linked project's status is `in_progress`.
  - The "Draft" tab hides items whose project is already `in_progress`.
  - Implementation detail: We treat project status `active` in Supabase as UI `In Progress` and map badges and counters accordingly. Counts and filters are computed client-side.
  - For the `In Progress` state, card action shows "Start Work" instead of "Submit for Review".
  - Added "View File" (opens `file_url`) and an "Edit" dialog for draft items to update title, url, and file. Edit is hidden once project is `in_progress` or content leaves draft.
  - After submitting, UI switches the tab to In Progress for immediate feedback.
  - Ensure RLS policies for `public.content` allow select/insert/update/delete for your chosen roles (anon/authenticated) or proxy writes via a server route with service role.

  Schema expectations for best experience:
  - `content(id uuid, title text, status text, created_at timestamptz default now())`
  - In current DB (`content_status` enum): allowed statuses are `draft` and `published`. UI maps:
    - Submit for Review: keeps `draft` (informational only)
    - Approve: sets `published`
    - Reject: sets `draft`
  - Optional: `url text, target_keyword text, word_count int, project_id uuid, deadline timestamptz, updated_at timestamptz, file_url text`

- Priority shown in UI is not persisted unless you add `priority` column.
- Description input is not stored unless you add `description` column.

- Services layer for dashboard data:
  - `services/dashboardData.ts`: metrics counts, task status distribution, and recent activity loaders.
- Dashboard components updated to live data with loading/error states:
  - `components/dashboard/kpi-widgets.tsx`
  - `components/dashboard/task-progress-chart.tsx`
  - `components/dashboard/recent-activity.tsx`

### Content Page Overhaul (2025-09-17)

- Rebuilt `components/content-page-content.tsx` to mirror the `/tasks` flow.
- Added project selector, monthly change and in-progress stats.
- New create dialog after selecting a project with required fields: Title, Description, Page URL, Keywords, File upload.
- Status lanes: In Progress, Under Review, Completed, Disapproved.
- Actions:
  - In Progress: View, Submit for Review, Delete.
  - Under Review: View, Approve, Disapprove.
  - Completed/Disapproved: read-only badges.
- Implementation detail to avoid Supabase enum errors on `content.status`:
  - In Progress derived from `projects.status === "active"`.
  - Under Review/Disapproved tracked via local persisted flags until enum is extended.
  - Approve writes `content.status = 'published'`.
- File uploads go to Supabase Storage bucket defined by `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`.

Future migration (optional): add `in_progress`, `under_review`, `disapproved` to `content.status` enum and switch UI to rely solely on `content.status`.

### Sidebar UX Improvements
### Projects Section (Supabase-backed)
- Data source moved to Supabase via `services/projectsService.ts`:
  - `fetchProjectsWithStats()` loads projects and joins client names, then computes task totals and completion progress from `tasks`.
  - `createProject()` inserts new projects with `due_date`.
- UI changes:
  - `components/projects-list-enhanced.tsx` now fetches via the service with loading/error states.
  - Progress percentage and task totals are real, based on Supabase data.
  - Stats cards (`Total`, `Active`, `Completed`, `On Hold`) derive from the loaded projects.
  - Removed 3-dots context menu; left clear actions only.
- Create flow:
  - `components/create-project-dialog.tsx` uses dark-themed inputs and adds a `Due Date` field.
  - On submit, it calls `createProject()` to save to Supabase.

### Supabase Schema Notes
### Clients Section (Supabase-backed)
- Replaced Convex clients with Supabase-only data:
  - `services/clientsService.ts` exposes `fetchClients()` and `createClient()`.
  - `components/clients-page-content.tsx` now:
    - Loads clients from Supabase (no hardcoded/Convex data).
    - Creates clients via Supabase and updates local list; shows a clear error toast if insert fails.
    - Uses dark-themed inputs for consistency.
  - Deletion is not wired to Supabase yet; the button shows a not-implemented toast.

- Minimal tables: `clients`, `projects (status, due_date)`, `tasks (status)`, `content`, `backlinks`, `reports (actor, ...)` with public read RLS policies for anon key.
- See SQL in repository notes or the previous comment for full schema and seed examples.
- `components/sidebar.tsx` now groups links and adds a collapsible "Modes" section; clearer Main Navigation label; works with collapsed sidebar.

### Env Vars
- Required:
  - SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS, ADMIN_EMAIL
  - JWT_SECRET
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

### Notes
- Cookies use `secure` flag only in production for local development compatibility.
- All new APIs return JSON and log server errors without leaking details to the client.
